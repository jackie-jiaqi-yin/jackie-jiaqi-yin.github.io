## Professional Summary

I’m **Jackie Jiaqi Yin**, a Senior AI Scientist at **Microsoft Copilot Notebooks**, where I build intelligent, context-aware systems that help people reason across their work. My focus is on combining large language models, retrieval-augmented generation, and multi-agent evaluation frameworks to make AI assistance more grounded, transparent, and useful.

With a background that spans **mathematics, biostatistics, and computer science**, I approach AI development as both a science and a design practice — balancing analytical rigor with an empathy for user experience. My work bridges data reasoning, system architecture, and evaluation methodology to ensure AI capabilities are measurable, trustworthy, and genuinely helpful to people.

## Experience

### Microsoft — Senior Applied Scientist  
*Aug 2020 – Present | Redmond, WA*  

**Copilot Notebooks (2025 – Present)**  
Building AI features focused on data curation, context engineering—including prompt reasoning, tool usage, and LLM-as-Judge evaluation for scenarios without ground truth. As an early senior member, I help shape the AI foundations that ensure product-wide reliability and scalability.

**Amplify AI & Business Insights (2020 – 2025)**  
Led recommendation systems for M365 Support, including a two-tower model and Thompson sampling bandit approach. Served as the core scientist behind the Forecasting Service, now deployed in Dynamics 365 for both internal and external Microsoft customers. Defined fundamental ML infrastructure and experimentation frameworks for Microsoft 365 support.

**Key Themes Across Roles:**  
Applied AI system design, data reasoning and context engineering, LLM prompt and evaluation strategy (LLM-as-Judge), recommender systems, forecasting and experimentation frameworks.

## Beyond Work

Outside of work, I’m passionate about **tennis** — both as a physical discipline and a way to practice focus, rhythm, and patience. I’m learning to turn it into a life-long hobby. I also enjoy experimenting with new recipes and exploring how creative processes mirror scientific thinking.
