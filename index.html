  <h2>Welcome to My AI Playground ✨</h2>

  <p>👋 Hi there! I'm Jackie Yin (殷佳祺 | Yīn Jiā-Qí), a Senior AI Scientist at Microsoft Copilot Notebooks with a passion for all things AI! I specialize in LLMs, agentic AI systems, and RAG optimization.</p>

  <p>Currently at Copilot Notebooks, I'm responsible for end-to-end AI product development — from data curation to prompt engineering, tool calling, feature launch, and AI evaluation, delivering tier 1 AI features for Ignite.</p>
  
  <p>My AI journey began in 2024, but before jumping into the AI revolution, I worked on machine learning, recommendation systems, forecasting, and A/B experiments — leading end-to-end projects that helped launch successful products! Notably, as the sole scientist, I developed the algorithm for the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-service/use/use-volume-forecasting">Dynamics 365 volume forecasting feature</a>. I'm a bit of a learning addict and love sharing what I discover along the way.</p>

  <p>🌱 This digital garden is where I share:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Technical insights from my adventures with advanced AI systems</li>
    <li>Research findings and practical strategies for enterprise AI</li>
    <li>Personal musings on emerging tech that fascinates me</li>
    <li>Career advice for fellow travelers in the AI/ML landscape</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Whether you're an AI researcher, industry pro, or just curious about this exciting AI world, I hope you'll find something valuable here! Let's learn and grow together as I document my journey and discoveries. 🚀</p>
