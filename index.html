  <h2>Welcome to My AI Playground ‚ú®</h2>

  <p>üëã Hi there! I'm Jackie Yin (‰Ω≥Á•∫ | JiƒÅ-Q√≠), a Senior Applied Scientist at Microsoft with a passion for all things AI! I specialize in LLMs, agentic AI systems, and RAG optimization.</p>

  <p>My AI journey began in 2024, but before jumping into the AI revolution, I worked on machine learning, recommendation systems, and A/B experiments ‚Äî leading end-to-end projects that helped launch successful products! I'm a bit of a learning addict and love sharing what I discover along the way.</p>

  <p>üå± This digital garden is where I share:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Technical insights from my adventures with advanced AI systems</li>
    <li>Research findings and practical strategies for enterprise AI</li>
    <li>Personal musings on emerging tech that fascinates me</li>
    <li>Career advice for fellow travelers in the AI/ML landscape</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Whether you're an AI researcher, industry pro, or just curious about this exciting AI world, I hope you'll find something valuable here! Let's learn and grow together as I document my journey and discoveries. üöÄ</p>
